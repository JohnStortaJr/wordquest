# wordquest
A word guessing game clone created as a basic Python learning exercise

The code is neither optimized nor clean. Simply a way to learn. Over time, I will iterate through it and make improvements.

6 chances to guess a 5-letter word.

Each guess reveals the following...
Blue: The letter is in the correct position
Yellow: The letter is in the word, but in the wrong position
Gray: The letter is not in the word
